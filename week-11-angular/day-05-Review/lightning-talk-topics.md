##Lightning Talks 2

Your goal is to create a 5 minute presentation on a technology/tool/language/library that you're interested in. Please use this an an opportunity to research something you think you might use in your final project, or something that you've heard of and you're simply curious about!

We encourage you to dive right in to your presentation with a code-sample / demo! Please also create a brief gist / cheat sheet outlining your findings and any helpful resources you discover in your research.

- What problem does it solve?
- How do you use it?

**Due**: Monday and Tuesday morning, 9:17-10:30am slot.
