#Flash Messages and Validations  
Clone [this](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/flash_validator) repository and implement flash messaging to 
ensure the user knows what is required to properly sign up for an account with the validator app.  
TODO tasks are located inside `app/models/user.rb`.

To ensure app is ready to be ran with testing, run `bundle install` and `bundle update` after cloning.
